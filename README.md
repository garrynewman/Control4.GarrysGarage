# Garry's Garage Driver

Custom garage door driver for control4

# Why

I made this driver because I have sensors on my garage doors and wanted to reflect those in the UI. 

This is useful to me because I don't have to look out of the window to see if the garage door is fully closed.

# How

This driver gives you a Relay and 2 Sensors to plug into.

One sensor is for when the door is partially opened, one is for when the door is fully opened. This state will be reflected in the UI.

It also gives immediate visual feedback when the button is pressed and it's either opening or closing.

# Using

You know the deal, Add New Driver - add the c4z file. If you want to edit it, just copy the edited files in the c4z file using 7zip or something.
